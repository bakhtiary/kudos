kudos.txt:
The idea is that a project taking part in kudos will contain a kudos.json file in the root folder of it's repository. The kudos file contains a list of resources that it has used. Now resources is a general term, examples of resources are in the next section. The kudos file also contains the details of the developers of the system, this includes the paypal account for the developer.



The distributor:

This is a webservice that has two main jobs, first it needs to collect donations from the donators and distribute it according to the policies of the donator. Second it needs to publish it's donations so that all distributors can make an informed decision when alocating the donations of its members.

The crawler:
A distributor would use a crawler to crawl the kudos files so that the distributor can create a dependency graph.
